# SwingBeans

Nice java repetition for me, specifically swing.

This is a NetBeans project.

I have learnt it with eclipse, but I like Apache NetBeans better now, because you don't need to install the stupid plug-in "WindowBuilder".

jdk needs to be installed separately, but I like that.

By repetition of swing, I speciffically mean the use of JTable and TableModels.

ChatGPT 3.5 helped me a lot to accomplish this.
